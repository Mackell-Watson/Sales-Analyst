## Problem Statement

The goal of this project was to develop a Product Sales Analysis Dashboard using Power BI to provide actionable insights into the sales performance across different regions and product categories. Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Total Sales, Total Profit, Units Sold, and Total Orders are tracked and analyzed to assess overall business health. The dashboard is segmented by regions, including West, Southeast, South, Northeast, and Midwest, and breaks down sales by month to reveal trends over time. Additionally, the dashboard highlights the top 10 highest revenue-generating locations and states with the highest units sold, offering a comprehensive view of sales performance for strategic decision-making. This tool supports managers and stakeholders in identifying areas for improvement and optimizing sales strategies.
